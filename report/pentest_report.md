# Penetration Test Report (Ethical Home Router Audit)

**Client:** Personal Home Network  
**Assessment Type:** Authorized LAN-only security assessment  
**Target:** Spectrum / Askey Home Router  
**Target IP:** 192.168.1.1  
**Date:** January 2026  
**Tester:** Marc Hernandez (Mrhonda12)

---

## 1. Executive Summary
This assessment documents a legal and ethical security audit performed on a personally owned home router. The goal was to identify exposed services on the internal network, evaluate basic security posture, and recommend defensive hardening steps. Testing was limited to non-destructive scanning and enumeration within the local network environment.

Overall, the router presents a reasonable security posture with limited exposed services and a large number of filtered ports, suggesting firewall controls are active. Minor configuration risks were identified, such as HTTP exposure on port 80 and the use of a vendor default SSL certificate.

## 2. Scope
### In-Scope
- Spectrum / Askey router located on local network
- Internal LAN testing only (192.168.1.0/24)
- Nmap scanning and service enumeration
- Safe NSE vulnerability script checks

### Out of Scope
- Any exploitation attempts
- Password attacks / brute force
- Denial of Service (DoS)
- WAN/internet-side scanning

---

## 3. Methodology
The assessment followed a basic pentesting workflow:

1. Host discovery and verification
2. TCP port scanning
3. Service and version detection
4. Safe script-based vulnerability checks
5. Risk rating and mitigation recommendations

---

## 4. Tools Used
- Kali Linux (VirtualBox VM - Bridged Adapter)
- Nmap 7.98
- arp-scan 1.10.0

---

## 5. Results Summary

### Open Ports
| Port | Protocol | Service | Notes |
|------|----------|---------|------|
| 53 | TCP | DNS | Detected as DNS service |
| 80 | TCP | HTTP | lighttpd 1.4.59 |
| 443 | TCP | HTTPS | lighttpd 1.4.59 |

### Additional Observations
- 846 ports closed (reset)
- 151 ports filtered (no response)
- OS fingerprint indicates Linux kernel range 4.19–5.15 (router firmware environment)

---

## 6. Findings

### Finding 1 — HTTP Admin Interface Exposed (Port 80)
**Severity:** Medium  
**Evidence:** `80/tcp open http lighttpd 1.4.59`  
**Impact:** HTTP traffic is unencrypted; in unsafe environments this could expose sensitive session traffic or credentials.  
**Recommendation:**
- Disable HTTP management if possible
- Enforce HTTPS-only management
- Restrict router admin access to LAN only

---

### Finding 2 — Vendor Default SSL Certificate in Use
**Severity:** Low / Informational  
**Evidence:** SSL certificate CN: `askey.com`  
**Impact:** Vendor default/self-signed certificates may encourage users to ignore browser security warnings, increasing risk of social engineering or unsafe trust behavior.  
**Recommendation:**
- Continue to use HTTPS instead of HTTP
- Avoid accessing router admin interface on public networks
- Replace certificate if router supports it (often not available on ISP routers)

---

### Finding 3 — DNS Service Available on TCP/53
**Severity:** Low  
**Evidence:** `53/tcp open domain`  
**Impact:** DNS services should not be exposed externally. If misconfigured, DNS may be abused for amplification/open resolver activity.  
**Recommendation:**
- Confirm DNS service is LAN-only
- Disable WAN-side DNS exposure
- Keep firmware up to date

---

## 7. Hardening Recommendations (Blue Team)
- Disable WPS
- Disable Remote Management / WAN administration
- Disable UPnP unless needed
- Use WPA3 (or WPA2/WPA3 mixed)
- Set strong router admin password
- Update router firmware regularly
- Monitor device list and block unknown devices
- Separate smart devices on Guest Wi-Fi

---

## 8. Conclusion
The router presents a generally good security posture with minimal services exposed to the local network and firewall filtering in place. No high-severity vulnerabilities were detected via safe scanning methods. Defensive hardening should focus on enforcing HTTPS-only management, disabling WPS/UPnP where possible, and ensuring router firmware and authentication controls remain strong.
